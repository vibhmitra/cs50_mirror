Linked Lists
useing pointer to link part of memory

Kinda like this
[2]  []  [3]
[]  [1]  []

- we are taking twice a space since we are storing in linked list
- but is giving flexibility so thats okay :)

Linked list is like making
- like making a rectangle
- it makes stuff efficiencent
- we are trading off space but we are saving time by not copying everother stuffs to new chunk of memory

               ðŸ‘‡ this is just for so that we can use it in making those nodes
typedef struct node
{
    int number;
    node *next;

} node;

# Trees
- on list we can not do binary search
- thats why we use binary search tree to easily search.

typedef struct node
{
    int number;
    struct node *left;
    struct node *right;
} node;


bool search(node *tree, int number)
{
    if (tree == NULL)
    {
        return false;
    }
    else if (number < tree->number)
    {
        return search(tree->left, number);
    }
        else if (number > tree->number)
    {
        return search(tree->right, number);
    }
}

- catch with bstree is the balance

// insering O(n) linear
// O(logn)

# Dictionary

word | defination
    or
key  |  value

# Hashing
- takes input produces output

- Hash function
  - Bucket Tie means break the big problem into smaller problem
  - Hash table kinda like array and linked list
  - Think if as of Phonebook A, B, C .. Z division, then each bucket has like multiple names
  - but collision can happen
    typedef struct node
    {
        char *name;
        char *number;
        struct node next;
    } node;

    node *table[26]

    I/P  -> [HASH FN]  -> O/P
    mario -> [HASH FN] -> 12

    int simple_hash(char *word)
    {
        return toupper(Word[0]) - 'A';
    }

    - But if this table becomes big and bigger space will be wasted

    - like we check first few letter to avoid collision but it will become complecated sort of.
    unsigned int hash(const char *word)
    {
        return toupper(Word[0]) - 'A';
    }
    // O(n/k)

    - Ideal Hash function do not have collosion, all hash function tries to approcah O(1) constant time that is.

# Tries
- tree of array
- represent a-z alpha.
- used for large data handling
- we compromise space to get constant o(1) time complexity


typedef struct node
{
    struct node *children[26];
    char *number;
} node;

// tries are fast, hard to implement tho
