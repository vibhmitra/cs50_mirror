-- Ruth Statement:  Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away.
--                  If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot
--                  in that time frame.
-- Eugene Stmt   :  I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's
--                  bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
-- Raymond Stmt  :  As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute. In the call,
--                  I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
--                  The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.
